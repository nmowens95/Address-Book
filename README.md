This is a simple Python Project to practice using different operations that work with documents.

The project is supposed to simulate a very simple contact list that would be something similar to what a phone would hold.

This project is set us as a REPL (read, evaluate, print, loop) and should be able to:

Add: adds a contact to a contact list

Delete: delete a contact, per line of the specified search, without deleting other lines in a document

Search: able to find and return the given contact based on search components

Quit: simple exit of program


Future Improvements:

- Can be more functional, this is primarily just a basic starting point to work with the different operations you can work with on documents.
- Could be more useful if it found the characters of the search and gave a return even if the search input did not match the contact specifically.
- Add some sort of GUI, or make more user friendly in some sort of sense
- Set up in Json, parse information if necessary
- Add a DB such as SQLIte
